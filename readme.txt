Combine the addictiveness of online polls and the community features of comments to let your visitors rate and share opinions on famous people!

== Description ==

SendLove.to is a "people rating" plugin for bloggers and online publishers that frequently write about important people in the news: politicians, athletes, celebrities, musicians, artists, authors, and more. It creates controversial, living conversations on your website, across both old and new content, that help visitors discover and read more articles. Publishers report huge increases to time on site, page views, and return visitors with SendLove.to.

How it works:

Our plugin scans your articles for the names of over 2M famous people and enables social polling features on your site. As visitors rate and share their opinions on a person, their opinions appear in an interactive feed beneath *every* article -- past, present, and future -- that you write about that person. This creates highly visible, highly engaging conversations. Each opinion in the feed links back to the article that inspired it, so readers discover and read more articles through the voice of their peers.

SendLove.to works perfectly with Disqus, Facebook Comments, WordPress Comments, Intense Debate... or all on its own!

1. SendLove.to enables inline Quick Polls, the ability for visitors to rate and share opinions on the people you write about, directly within your article.
2. Opinions appear beneath articles in an interactive feed for each person you mention. Visitors can read, comment, and vote on the opinions of others and discover links to more of your articles.
3. Moderate the opinions left by your visitors. We automatically detect spam and you can optionally enable a profanity filter.
4. Decide who you want to be rated and discussed on your site. Ignore certain people or even add your own!
5. Learn more about your community, monitor activity, and find out which people and articles your readers love (or love to hate).

== Changelog ==

= 1.27 (08/23/2011)
* This version revises a change made in 1.26 which inserted the JavaScript when wp_footer() was called.  This has been abandoned since the use of wp_footer() is not as popular as the WordPress docs lead one to believe. :)  The new method provides additional support for cases like this. 

= 1.26 (08/19/2011) =
* Added an advanced configuration option which allows users to use an alternate embed method if their templates don't utilize the comments_template() function.
* The bulk of the embed code now resides in the footer of the page.
* Preferences are now preserved if you do a re-install or upgrade of the plugin.

= 1.24 (08/09/2011) =
* Official WordPress directory release

= 1.22 (08/08/2011) =
* Improvements to the Settings page to clarify the signup process.  Also added visual indication that settings have been successfully saved.

= 1.21 (07/22/2011) =
* We now ensure the code is only placed into the page one time.  Third-party plugins were occasionally requesting the comment template multiple times which was causing duplication.

= 1.0 (06/15/2011) =
* Initial Release
